H&M is one of the largest fashion retailers in the world. Each Christmas the staff receive discounts as a thank you. Due to the pandemic, their original printed vouchers had to be reconsidered. H&M approached us a month before Christmas to help them find a solution.

We designed and developed a mobile-first platform for the 7000+ staff and suppliers in Spain and Portugal. Users could easily access their discount coupons, redeem them in any H&M store or online and digitally share  them with  friends and family. We combined a very intuitive interface with a robust web architecture (100% uptime), which resulted in an average of 6k daily unique visits and over 30k coupons being shared during the promotion.

The platform and the interface design was an instant success amongst the staff, and we are delighted H&M have asked us to manage this project two years in a row.
