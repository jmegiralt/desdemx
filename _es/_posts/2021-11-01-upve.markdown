The UPVE is a leading institution in agro engineering in the northern Mexico region.

The new brand identity and the communication strategy had to include the wide diversity of collectives that connect with the university: current and potential students, alumni, local parents and families, university staff, local and regional businesses, councils and the overall local community, where the school plays a key role in development…

We created a modular approach that gave flexibility to the diverse and complex communication needs that the brand required.
